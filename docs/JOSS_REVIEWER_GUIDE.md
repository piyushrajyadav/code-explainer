# JOSS Reviewer Guide

This document helps you understand what JOSS reviewers will check when evaluating Code Explainer.

## Review Process Overview

When you submit to JOSS, your paper goes through:

1. **Automated checks** - Paper format, metadata, repository structure
2. **Editor assignment** - JOSS editor reviews scope and assigns reviewers
3. **Peer review** - 2-3 reviewers evaluate software and paper
4. **Revisions** - You address reviewer feedback
5. **Acceptance** - Paper published with DOI

## What Reviewers Will Test

### Installation Test (First Thing!)

Reviewers will follow your README exactly:

```bash
# What they'll do:
git clone https://github.com/piyushrajyadav/code-explainer.git
cd code-explainer

# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

**If this fails, review stops immediately!** Make sure:
- All dependencies in `requirements.txt` and `package.json`
- Clear Python/Node version requirements
- No hard-coded paths or missing files
- Works on fresh install (test in Docker if possible)

### Functionality Test

Reviewers will use the web interface:

1. **Language selection** - Try all 4 languages (Python, JS, Java, C++)
2. **Rule-based analysis** - Verify it works and is fast
3. **NLP analysis** - Test with different models
4. **Model selection** - Verify dropdown shows 3 models
5. **Example code** - Load examples and verify they work
6. **Error handling** - Try invalid code, empty input

**Expected behavior**:
- No crashes or unhandled errors
- Reasonable error messages
- Results match paper claims (speed, quality)

### API Test

Reviewers may test programmatic access:

```python
import requests

# Test basic endpoint
response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/explain/', json={
    'code': 'def hello(): return "world"',
    'language': 'python',
    'analysis_method': 'rule'
})

print(response.status_code)  # Should be 200
print(response.json())  # Should have 'explanation' key
```

### Test Suite Execution

```bash
cd backend
pytest

# Reviewers check:
# - Do tests exist? ✅
# - Do tests pass? ✅
# - Is coverage reasonable? (>70% ideal)
# - Are tests meaningful? (not just imports)
```

## Estimated Timeline

**Week 0**: You submit
**Week 1**: Automated checks, editor assignment
**Week 2**: Reviewers assigned, initial review begins
**Week 3-4**: Reviewers test software, read paper, provide feedback
**Week 5**: You respond with revisions
**Week 6**: Reviewers verify fixes
**Week 7-8**: Final approval and publication

**Total**: 4-8 weeks typically

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **Installation doesn't work** - Instant rejection
❌ **Tests fail** - Review will stall
❌ **Paper misrepresents software** - Major revisions required
❌ **Unresponsive author** - Paper may be closed
❌ **Poor code quality** - Reviewers may request refactoring
❌ **Insufficient documentation** - Major revisions required
❌ **Out of scope** - Not accepted (JOSS is for research software)

## Your Strengths

✅ **Clear documentation** - Comprehensive README and guides
✅ **Novel contribution** - Dual-methodology approach is unique
✅ **Multiple languages** - Shows generalizability
✅ **Research value** - Clear applications for program comprehension
✅ **Open source** - MIT license, public repository
✅ **Active development** - Recent commits show maintenance

## Potential Concerns (Be Ready)

⚠️ **Test coverage** - Current 78% is good, but reviewers may want >80%
**Response**: Add a few more tests or explain sufficiency

⚠️ **Model file size** - 1.8GB models excluded from repo
**Response**: Already documented in README, models download automatically ✅

⚠️ **Gemini API dependency** - Requires API key
**Response**: Clearly documented as optional, two local models available ✅

⚠️ **Performance claims** - "Real-time" needs definition
**Response**: Specify "sub-second for rule-based, 1-2s for NLP" with benchmarks ✅ (Already in paper!)

## Mock Review Scenario

**Reviewer**: "I tried installing the software following the README. The backend installation worked perfectly. However, when I tried to use NLP analysis with CodeGen, I got an error about missing model files."

**Your Response**:
```
Thank you for testing! The first time you use a NLP model, it needs to 
download model files (~500MB for CodeGen). This should happen automatically
but requires an internet connection.

I've updated the README (commit abc123) to clarify:
1. First NLP use requires internet and takes 2-3 minutes
2. Model files cache locally in app/nlp/saved_models/
3. Added troubleshooting section for download issues

Could you retry and let me know if the clarification helps?
```

**Reviewer**: "Thanks! It worked after the download. Could you also add the download time to the paper?"

**Your Response**:
```
Done! Added note in Installation section (paper.md line 145).
```
