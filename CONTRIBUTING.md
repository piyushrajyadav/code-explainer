## Development Setup

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

### Frontend Development

cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add type hints where appropriate

## Adding New Language Support

To add support for a new programming language:

1. Create a new analyzer in `backend/app/analyzers/`
2. Implement the analyzer interface:
   ```python
   def analyze_<language>(code: str) -> dict:
       # Your implementation
       pass
   ```
3. Add language patterns to `CodeProcessor._init_language_patterns()`
4. Update the frontend language dropdown
5. Add example code for the new language
6. Update documentation

## Adding New AI Models

To add a new AI model:

1. Update `backend/app/nlp/model.py` to support the new model
2. Add model information to `get_analyze_methods()` in `backend/app/main.py`
3. Update frontend model dropdown
4. Add model documentation
5. Test thoroughly with various code samples

## Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for major changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update API documentation if endpoints change
- Add examples for new features

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

Examples:
```
Add support for Rust language analysis
Fix memory leak in NLP model loading
Update README with installation instructions
```
